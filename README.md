<h2>Project status</h2>
Right now it is just a raw idea.<br>
Currently I'm figuring out what crates to use and how the app will generally function.<br>

<h2>What is this project about</h2>
PAR is short for Pixiv Artist Reviewer.<br>
It is going to be a small gui app that will allow a user to view and interact (follow, unfollow, bookmark images, etc.) with the artists that the user currently follows on <a href="https://www.pixiv.net/en/">pixiv</a>.<br>
Ideally I would make this app a desktop widget, but we will see how it goes.<br>

<h2>Why?</h2>
I'm currently learning Rust and I wanted to try working on some project with it. This was the first satisfactory project idea that came to my mind.<br>
I also decided to learn GitHub at the same time, so this project is pretty much my first experience with it.<br>
